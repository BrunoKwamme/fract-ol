# fract-ol
Fract-ol is a 42 project that uses "minilibx" a 42 graphic lib to improve your skills and knowledge about graphic computation.

## What is fractol ?

#### A fractal is a geometric shape that exhibits self-similarity at different scales. In layman's terms, it's a pattern that repeats itself over and over again, creating intricate and infinitely complex designs.
#### Fractals can be generated using mathematical formulas or algorithms. These formulas are repeated over and over again, creating a feedback loop that results in the complex shapes we see.

# Executing

## Compiling C archives

```
make
```

#### fractol must receive more arguments: using "mandelbrot" or "julia"

## Mandelbrot example

```
./fractol mandelbrot
```

#### "julia" can receive two more arguments manipulating the fractol shape, with the objective to reach differents variations of julia's original design the second argument range is -2~2

## Julia first example 

```
./fractol julia
```

## Julia second example

```
./fractol julia -0.70176 -0.3842
```
